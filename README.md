# Automatic Speed Controlled Exhaust System

## Overview

The Automatic Speed Controlled Exhaust System is an embedded systems project that automatically controls the speed of an exhaust fan using a microcontroller. The system uses a breadboard circuit and an LCD display to monitor and show system status in real time.

## Features

* Automatic fan speed control
* Real-time status display on LCD
* Breadboard-based prototype
* Energy-efficient ventilation control
* Simple and low-cost implementation

## Components Used

* Microcontroller (Arduino Uno or compatible)
* Exhaust fan (DC fan)
* LCD display (16x2)
* Breadboard
* Jumper wires
* Power supply

## Working Principle

The microcontroller controls the exhaust fan based on programmed logic. The LCD displays system information such as fan status. The system improves ventilation efficiency and reduces unnecessary power usage.

## Applications

* Smart ventilation systems
* Home automation
* Temperature-controlled exhaust systems
* Embedded systems learning projects

## Future Improvements

* Add temperature sensor for automatic temperature-based control
* Add PWM control for precise speed regulation
* Add IoT monitoring
